# TCP Low-Rate-DDoS on 5GmmWave Network - NS3
Network Simulation Project with NS-3. This project is about to simulate TCP Low-Rate-DDoS on 5GmmWave Network.


# Topology
The topology used to simulate this attack contains 7 nodes as follows:\
n0 -> enb (base station)\
n1 -> arini (UE legitimate User)\
a1-100 -> endro (UE attackers)\
n2 -> gateway\
n3 -> yuri (receiver)
